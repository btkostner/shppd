# Alternatives

Obviously this project is not the only one of its kind. This was indended to be a simple project to build a working Elixir project that is not overly complicated and over engineered. It's also hugely helpful to see other code examples of other package tracking projects.

Here are some other projects that are great for referencing:

- https://github.com/jkeen/tracking_number
- https://github.com/jkeen/tracking_number_data
- https://github.com/sauladam/shipment-tracker

Big thank you to these projects for being open source and providing great examples for others to learn from.
